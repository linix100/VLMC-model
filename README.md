# VLMC model

​	J. Rissanen modified Markov Chains of memory length n by assuming that the current state of a string is independent of the symbols in its past preceding a context of the length which is a function of the past itself. He developed a construction algorithm of contexts stochastic suffix tree for compressing stationary time series and proved its consistency. Rissanen’s Variable memory Length Markov Chains (VLMC) were formally applied for classifying non-stationary proteins by G. Bejerano and others by training their VLMC models.

​	We apply VLMC training of presumably stationary parts of piece-wise stationary time series for testing homogeneity of longer regions and, if homogeneity is rejected, for identifying most discriminating contexts.
